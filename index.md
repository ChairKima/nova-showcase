        <h2>The Data Engineering Bottleneck: Beyond the Hype</h2>
        <p>Businesses today are rich in data but often find data engineering a major hurdle. It's not just about writing code; it's about navigating a fragmented landscape of tools (Kafka, Spark, Airflow, SQL, Python, cloud services), debuggingÊ∑±Â§ú pipeline failures, managing schema changes, and constantly fighting performance issues. This is the "unglamorous reality" that stifles innovation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Why Many "AI Data Agents" Disappoint</h2>
        <p>The promise of AI in data engineering is huge, but many early attempts fall short. They often act as thin wrappers, translating natural language directly to specific tool syntax (like SQL) without true understanding. This leads to common frustrations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of Context:</strong> AI can't magically grasp unique business rules or data quirks without a robust way to learn and apply this specific context.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Quality Blind Spots:</strong> Real-world data is imperfect. Simplistic AI-generated queries can produce silently incorrect results if they don't build in data validation.</li>
            <li><strong>Opacity & Mistrust:</strong> When AI outputs are wrong, the "blame the prompt" response erodes trust. True auditability is often missing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Simply put, a chat interface over SQL generation doesn't solve the fundamental challenges.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Nova's Approach: A True AI-Native Ecosystem</h2>
        <p><strong>Nova is fundamentally different.</strong> We are building an <strong>AI-first data engineering ecosystem</strong> where the AI is a genuine partner, engineered for transparency and control.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="capability-icon">üîë</span> <strong>The Nova DSL ‚Äì Clarity & Auditability:</strong> When you speak to Nova, it translates your intent into its own high-level, human-readable <strong>Nova Data Specific Language (DSL)</strong>. This DSL is the explicit, inspectable blueprint of your pipeline, not a black box. It details exactly what Nova understood and how it plans to execute.</li>
            <li><span class="capability-icon">üß†</span> <strong>Intelligent by Design (The Nova Brain):</strong> Our AI Agent isn't just a translator; it's being built with an inherent understanding of data engineering principles, patterns, and best practices. It uses the Nova DSL as its native language to reason about and construct optimal data solutions.</li>
            <li><span class="capability-icon">ü§ù</span> <strong>Empowering Engineers, Not Replacing Them:</strong> Nova automates the complex, repetitive, and error-prone tasks. This allows human data engineers to focus on strategic architecture, providing critical business context, and ensuring the quality and governance of data ‚Äì working alongside an incredibly powerful AI assistant.</li>

        <h2>What Nova's MVP Delivers Today: Tangible Proof</h2>
        <p>Our current MVP powerfully demonstrates this new paradigm. Nova can already:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="capability-icon">üó£Ô∏è</span> Engage in conversational pipeline construction using plain English.</li>
            <li><span class="capability-icon">‚úçÔ∏è</span> Automatically generate clear, structured Nova DSL from these conversations.</li>
            <li><span class="capability-icon">üöÄ</span> Execute these DSL-defined pipelines end-to-end, seamlessly integrating with:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Live Kafka streams, Amazon S3 (reading CSVs & JSONL).</li>
                    <li><strong>Transformations:</strong> Robust filtering, tumbling & sliding time windows, and key aggregations (sums, counts, distinct counts).</li>
                    <li><strong>Sinks:</strong> Live data delivery to PostgreSQL, Google BigQuery, Amazon S3, local CSV files, and console output.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means Nova is already capable of handling significant real-world ETL and streaming scenarios, turning ideas into operational cloud data solutions in minutes, with full transparency into the process via the generated DSL.</p>
