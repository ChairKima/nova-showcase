        <h2>Data Engineering Today: The "Unglarmorous Reality"</h2>
        <p>Building data infrastructure is critical, but it's often a battle. Engineers wrestle with a sprawling array of tools (Kafka, Spark, Airflow, SQL, Python, cloud services), spending most of their time debugging broken pipelines, dealing with upstream data changes, and fighting performance fires ‚Äì often at 3 AM. This isn't just inefficient; it's a major roadblock to getting timely insights from data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Why "AI Agent" Platforms Often Miss the Mark</h2>
        <p>Many emerging "AI data tools" promise a quick fix but often fall short, leading to skepticism. They struggle because true data engineering is deeply context-dependent and data quality is rarely perfect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Context is King (and Hard for AI):</strong> AI can't magically understand unique business rules, undocumented legacy system quirks, or the true meaning behind a "null" value without robust mechanisms to learn and apply this context.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Quality Challenges:</strong> Real-world data is messy. Simple AI-generated queries can produce silently incorrect results if they don't account for inconsistencies, missing fields, or subjective data quality rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Transparency & Auditability:</strong> If an AI output is wrong, who's accountable? The "prompt was bad" or "context was insufficient" excuses don't build trust or auditable systems.</li>
            <li><strong>The "Last Mile" Problem:</strong> AI might generate 80% of a query, but the last 20% often requires deep domain knowledge and understanding of specific data semantics (e.g., what *really* constitutes "revenue" for *this* department).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Simply layering a chat interface on top of SQL generation isn't enough to solve these fundamental challenges.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Nova's Approach: An AI-Native Ecosystem Built on Transparency</h2>
        <p><strong>Nova is fundamentally different.</strong> We're not just automating tasks; we're building an **AI-first data engineering ecosystem** where the AI is a true partner, designed to address the core complexities and trust issues head-on.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="capability-icon">üîë</span> <strong>The Nova DSL ‚Äì Clarity & Control:</strong> When you speak to Nova in English, it doesn't just spit out a black-box query. It translates your intent into its own high-level, human-readable **Nova Data Specific Language (DSL)**. This DSL is the explicit blueprint of your pipeline ‚Äì fully inspectable, auditable, and versionable. You see exactly what Nova understood and plans to execute.</li>
            <li><span class="capability-icon">üß†</span> <strong>Intelligent Agent (The Nova Brain - Vision):</strong> Our AI agent is being built to understand data engineering principles natively. The goal is not just pattern matching from NL to SQL, but deeper reasoning about data flow, transformations, best practices, and (in the future) even infrastructure implications.</li>
            <li><span class="capability-icon">üõ†Ô∏è</span> **Empowering, Not Just Replacing:** Nova aims to automate the toil ‚Äì the boilerplate coding, the repetitive configurations, the complex orchestrations. This frees up human data engineers to focus on strategic design, data quality strategy, interpreting results, and providing the critical business context that AI needs.</li>

        <h2>What Nova's MVP Delivers Today: Proof of Concept</h2>
        <p>Our current MVP demonstrates the power of this approach. Nova can already:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engage in conversational pipeline building via Natural Language.</li>
            <li>Generate clear, structured Nova DSL from these conversations.</li>
            <li>Execute these DSL-defined pipelines end-to-end, integrating with:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Live Kafka streams, Amazon S3 (CSVs, JSONL).</li>
                    <li><strong>Transformations:</strong> Robust filtering, tumbling & sliding time windows, and key aggregations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sinks:</strong> Live PostgreSQL, Google BigQuery, Amazon S3, local files, and console.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means you can already go from an English idea to data moving and transforming across your cloud services, with a transparent DSL defining the entire process.</p>
