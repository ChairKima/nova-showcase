        <h2>The Problem: Data Engineering is a Major Bottleneck</h2>
        <p>Businesses today are drowning in data but starving for insights. Why? Because building and managing the necessary data pipelines is often a slow, incredibly resource-intensive process. It demands highly specialized engineers skilled in a multitude of complex tools and coding languages, creating a significant barrier to agility and innovation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Our Solution: Nova ‚Äì Data Engineering, Reimagined by AI</h2>
        <p><strong>Nova</strong> is an AI-powered ecosystem that fundamentally changes how data engineering is done. We're making it conversational. You simply describe your data processing needs in plain English, and Nova's intelligent AI agent handles the rest: designing the optimal pipeline, generating its own robust execution plan (the Nova DSL), and running it. </p>
        <p>This means **no deep coding in multiple languages is needed** from your team, freeing them to focus on data insights, not infrastructure wrestling.</p>

        <h2>How Nova Works: Simple English to Powerful Pipelines</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; padding-left: 20px; font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>You Speak:</strong> Describe your data requirements conversationally (e.g., "Read user events from Kafka, filter for purchases, aggregate daily, and load to BigQuery").</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Nova Understands & Builds:</strong> Our AI Agent interprets your intent, designs the pipeline, and automatically generates the precise configuration in Nova's powerful internal language (DSL).</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Nova Executes:</strong> The Nova Runtime Engine takes this DSL and orchestrates the entire data flow, connecting to your sources (like Kafka, S3), performing transformations (filtering, windowing, aggregations), and delivering data to your chosen destinations (like PostgreSQL, BigQuery, S3).</li>
        </ol>
